    /**
     * Verifies a Webauthn P256 signature (Authentication Assertion) as described
     * in https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-verifying-assertion. We do not
     * verify all the steps as described in the specification, only ones relevant
     * to our context. Please carefully read through this list before usage.
     * Specifically, we do verify the following:
     * - Verify that authenticatorData (which comes from the authenticator,
     *   such as iCloud Keychain) indicates a well-formed assertion. If
     *   requireUserVerification is set, checks that the authenticator enforced
     *   user verification. User verification should be required if,
     *   and only if, options.userVerification is set to required in the request
     * - Verifies that the client JSON is of type "webauthn.get", i.e. the client
     *   was responding to a request to assert authentication.
     * - Verifies that the client JSON contains the requested challenge.
     * - Finally, verifies that (r, s) constitute a valid signature over both
     *   the authenicatorData and client JSON, for public key (x, y).
     *
     * We make some assumptions about the particular use case of this verifier,
     * so we do NOT verify the following:
     * - Does NOT verify that the origin in the clientDataJSON matches the
     *   Relying Party's origin: It is considered the authenticator's
     *   responsibility to ensure that the user is interacting with the correct
     *   RP. This is enforced by most high quality authenticators properly,
     *   particularly the iCloud Keychain and Google Password Manager were
     *   tested.
     * - Does NOT verify That c.topOrigin is well-formed: We assume c.topOrigin
     *   would never be present, i.e. the credentials are never used in a
     *   cross-origin/iframe context. The website/app set up should disallow
     *   cross-origin usage of the credentials. This is the default behaviour for
     *   created credentials in common settings.
     * - Does NOT verify that the rpIdHash in authData is the SHA-256 hash of an
     *   RP ID expected by the Relying Party: This means that we rely on the
     *   authenticator to properly enforce credentials to be used only by the
     *   correct RP. This is generally enforced with features like Apple App Site
     *   Association and Google Asset Links. To protect from edge cases in which
     *   a previously-linked RP ID is removed from the authorised RP IDs,
     *   we recommend that messages signed by the authenticator include some
     *   expiry mechanism.
     * - Does NOT verify the credential backup state: This assumes the credential
     *   backup state is NOT used as part of Relying Party business logic or
     *   policy.
     * - Does NOT verify the values of the client extension outputs: This assumes
     *   that the Relying Party does not use client extension outputs.
     * - Does NOT verify the signature counter: Signature counters are intended
     *   to enable risk scoring for the Relying Party. This assumes risk scoring
     *   is not used as part of Relying Party business logic or policy.
     * - Does NOT verify the attestation object: This assumes that
     *   response.attestationObject is NOT present in the response, i.e. the
     *   RP does not intend to verify an attestation.
